# Norwegian_Benchmarking
The code required to create a Multi-linear model of benchmarking norwegian powerplants and companies using data from the WMO system. The overall goal of this project is to demonstrate that an more accurate alternative to the WMO system can be made using acceptable statistical techniques without providing any additional work for the companies taking part in the benchmarking.
